# Drumkit Project

This [Drum Kit](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12383928) project was created following Section 13 of [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy. This is the fourth major project in the course. It mimics a drumkit set, with buttons onscreen that can be activated either by clicking or pressing keys - a great way to understand and use event listeners in JavaScript as well as further opportunity to toy with the Document Object Model.

## Overview

### The challenge

Create a mimic drumset. Employ your understanding of basic JavaScript as well as advanced DOM manipulation (event listeners).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript + DOM manipulation

### What I learned

I've been learning a lot in this course, and in this section where we focused on advanced JavaScript and more DOM manipulation, I learned...
- more about **event listeners** and the **kinds of events** that can trigger them.
- about JavaScript **objects** and **constructor functions**: I understood how objects can acquire both properties and methods through a constructor function.
- about **higher order functions** and **callback functions** and the relationship between them: While a higher order function is one that is able to accept another function as one of its inputs (e.g. the method ```addEventListener()```), a callback function is the function that is passed into a higher order one as an input (e.g., ```addEventListener()``` takes two inputs: a string representing the event type to be listened for, and a function to be executed only after that event is detected. So any function that is passed in as the second parameter of the method is a callback function); the latter then waits for a result from the computation of the function to proceed.
- a reinforced understanding of and acquired confidence with **anonymous functions**, which are declared with ```function() {}```.
